Section I. Summary of District Court Cases (FY 2016 to FY 2020)
Data was provided by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of General Counsel, derived from reports submitted by each bureau. These charts show all cases and payments to the Judgment Fund in FY 2016 to FY 2020, regardless of when the case was filed. Because the charts show cases filed under multiple statutes, numbers will not total. The total number of cases settled, pending, and adjudicated will not equal the total number filed due to cases filed prior to the five-year reporting period.

 1 Elijah E. Cummings Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act (CFEA Act) of 2020 amends the No FEAR Act to include additional reporting and posting requirements when discrimination has been found in EEO administrative and District Court cases. Agencies have until January 1, 2022 to implement these new reporting and posting requirements. The Department’s FY 2021 Report will reflect the CFEA Act changes.

6. A detailed description of the policy implemented by that agency relating to appropriate disciplinary actions against a Federal employee who-
i. discriminated against any individual in violation of any of the laws cited under section 201(a)(1) or (2), or
ii. committed another prohibited personnel practice that was revealed in the investigation of a complaint alleging a violation of any of the laws cited under section 201(a)(1) or (2), and with respect to each of such laws, the number of employees who are disciplined in accordance with such policy and the specific nature of the disciplinary action taken.
The Department’s policy, Disciplinary Action for Employees who Violate Antidiscrimination and Whistleblower Protection Laws, requires bureaus to establish a disciplinary policy and/or table of penalties providing for appropriate disciplinary actions for employees who have intentionally engaged in discrimination or retaliatory actions, including retaliation for whistleblowing activities. Bureaus are asked to provide a copy of their disciplinary policy and/or table of penalties as part of a program audit review the Department conducts at each bureau. In addition, the Department of the Treasury’s Rules of Conduct (31 CFR §0.217) state that: “(a) Employees shall not discriminate against or harass any other employee, applicant for employment, contractor, or person dealing with the Department on official business on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, political affiliation, marital status, parental status, veterans status, or genetic information. (b) Supervisors shall not retaliate against an employee for complaining about suspected unlawful discrimination or harassment, seeking accommodation for a disability, or otherwise exercising their right to be free from unlawful discrimination. (c) An employee who engages in discriminatory or retaliatory conduct may be disciplined under these regulations, as well as other applicable laws[...].”
Section II. Analysis of Administrative Complaints*
7. An analysis of the information described under paragraphs (1) through (6) (in conjunction with data provided to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in compliance with part 1614 of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations) including:
a. an examination of trends;

c. practical knowledge gained through experience; and
d. any actions planned or taken to improve complaint or civil rights programs of the agency.
A. Examination of Trends, Causal Analysis, and Practical Knowledge Gained Through Experience
Treasury’s complaint activity data demonstrated a 15.4% decrease in complaints filed from FY 2019 (395 complaints filed) to FY 2020 (334 complaints filed). The per capita rate of formal equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaints filed in FY 2020 saw a decrease as well, from 0.39% in FY 2019 (362 complainants) to 0.33% in FY 2020 (312 complainants).
* Administrative complaint data by fiscal year is based on the annual Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s 462 Report. Federal agencies are required to submit their administrative complaint data annually no later than October 31st. The 462 Report figures include EEO “mixed case” complaints but do not include class complaints.
For the last five fiscal years of complaints filed, the top basis was reprisal and the top issue was harassment (non-sexual). To deter harassment and reprisal in the workplace, the Department provides multiple training courses through the Integrated Talent Management System (ITMS) dealing with the prevention of harassment in the workplace for employees and supervisors. Treasury has updated its policy titled, Procedures for Addressing Allegations of Discriminatory Harassment, which instructs bureaus to establish and publicize procedures for reporting allegations of discriminatory harassment, conducting an inquiry, and making appropriate determinations based on the results of the inquiry. It also requires bureaus to report all allegations of sexual harassment to their respective Inspector General office. Treasury has a brochure titled, Workplace Harassment: Your Rights and Responsibilities, to educate Treasury employees on their rights and responsibilities as well as about the prevention of harassment in the workplace, which employees can access through the Department’s intranet site. In addition, the Department developed a sexual harassment training module, available on ITMS, for use throughout the Department. As part of ongoing EEO training conducted by Treasury bureaus, managers receive information on the EEO complaint process, prohibited discrimination, retaliation, and agency liability when discrimination or retaliation is found. The topic of reprisal is addressed in the Secretary’s annual EEO policy statement as well as in No FEAR Act training provided to new hires and biennially to all employees.

During FY 2020, the Department completed 96.8% of all investigations of EEO complaints in a timely manner, an increase from the timely completion rate of 93.6% in FY 2019. The Department continued to utilize a contract with the United States Postal Service to provide EEO investigative services and added a secondary contract with Martin-Miser, Inc. to supplement investigative services on an as needed basis. The Office of Civil Rights and Diversity (OCRD) continued to maintain the acceptance/ dismissal/final agency decision functions for the Department.

 In FY 2020, the Department completed 680 informal counselings, of which 96.7% were timely processed and 51.9% reached resolution through settlement or withdrawal. The Department’s 51.9% resolution rate of informal counselings demonstrates the Department’s commitment to minimize the effect of conflict that detracts from employee satisfaction and undermines organizational efficiency.

      The Department also provides information to managers and supervisors on alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques and encourages employees to consider this avenue when a complaint has been filed. The Department has a policy titled, Management Participation in Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) During the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Process, which requires management participation in ADR if the issue is suitable for ADR and ADR is elected by the complainant. For FY 2020, the Department established a goal of 45% ADR participation rate in the informal and 20% in the formal complaint process. For ADR in the informal process, the Department had a 56.9% participation rate, and in the formal process had an 8.9% participation rate.

   Through the Treasury Shared Neutrals (TSN) Program, Treasury maintains a nationwide cadre of certified and highly trained neutrals (also known as mediators). TSN mediators are employees from various Treasury bureaus trained in the art of mediation who voluntarily serve on a collateral-duty basis. Their objective is to assist bureaus in resolving all types of workplace disputes at the earliest stages of the conflict and to provide a resolution through mediation, facilitation, and coaching. In FY 2020, the TSN program completed 210 mediations and had a 43.8% resolution rate. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were not able to hold planned lunch and learn seminars to educate Treasury employees on various tools to deal with conflicts in the workplace in FY 2020, but plan to reinstitute such training, even if remote, in FY 2021.

B. Actions Taken to Improve Agency Complaint or Civil Rights Program
The Department continually reviews all aspects of its workforce demographics to ensure we are putting in place the right human capital and EEO initiatives, policies, and training programs to meet the needs of our workforce in order to accomplish our mission. Through this ongoing analysis, the Department gains practical knowledge and makes determinations on how best to address any shortcomings identified and how to advance the needs of the workforce.
In FY 2020, the Department conducted the following activities based on its analysis of workforce demographics, training needs, and human capital initiatives:
• Conducted a review of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FINCEN) diversity and inclusion, external civil rights, ADR, reasonable accommodation, anti-harassment, and EEO complaint programs.
• Worked with Enterprise Data Management (EDM) and Monster Analytics to improve reporting capability of new Data Insight (formerly Workforce Analytics) system, resulting in improved data analysis capabilities around workforce demographics. Trained 100% of the bureaus in using new system’s features.
• Continued to provide personal assistance services (PAS) for the Department’s severely disabled employees through the PAS program.
• Participated in the 27th Annual Federal Inter-Agency Days of Remembrance observation.
• Issued the Secretary’s annual EEO policy statement for FY 2020.
• Collaborated with Bureau EEO and Diversity and Inclusion staff to draft Treasury’s FY 2021- FY 2024 Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) and EEO Strategic Plan.
• Held quarterly meetings with the Bureaus’ EEO Officers to discuss EEO emerging issues, best practices and any programmatic concerns.
• Maintained a secondary EEO investigation services contact with Martin-Miser & Associates.
• Conducted one 8-hour refresher mediator training for current mediators.
• Completed a total of 210 mediations and successfully resolved 44% of these completed mediations.
• Provided training to the bureau MD-715 preparers on the use of the new MD-715 V2 workforce data tables and monitored bureau strategies to eliminate any identified barriers.
• Promoted the use of Operation Warfighter Internships as a tool to increase the hiring of veterans with disabilities.
• Implemented the Treasury-wide Reasonable Accommodation (RA) Tracking System to improve the timeliness and efficiency of providing reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities (PWD).
10

• Exceeded EEOC’s goal that 12% of all new permanent hires be PWD (15.6%) and exceeded the subgoal that 2% of those hires be persons with targeted disabilities (PWTD) (3.1%).
• Maintained a cadre of 21 certified trainers to assist the Department in providing Civil Treatment Training to the workforce.
• Published OCRD Advisory Newsletters and Manager’s Alerts to provide information on relevant EEO complaint program matters, changes to policy and/or procedures, workforce statistics, and important upcoming agency events/activities.
• Established the Treasury Asian Pacific American (TAPA) Employee Resource Group.
• Assisted the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Human Resources/Chief Human Capital Officer (DASHR/CHCO) with Human Capital Evaluation of the Bureau of Fiscal Service’s EEO and D&I programs.

The Department of the Treasury’s bureaus determine the training and tracking methods and timeframe to conduct biennial No FEAR Act training.
